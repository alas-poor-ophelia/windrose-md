## Version 1.5.5
This was a quick one because I realized that I had almost all the functionality to use Windrose as a battle map (if you wanted, it wouldn't be my first choice, but).

So you can now add a background to grid maps (import your map), add new objects with actual images (for character portraits). And with the ability to tie notes to objects, you can reference a note for each character or what have you, and have access to it on hover.

### Improvements
- Objects can now be created (or edited to use) with custom images. The image must be in your vault, and should be PNG or WEBP. There is now a third tab in the New Object modal (all of this is in the settings plugin) which will let you use an image vs pure unicode or RPG Awesome icons.
- Backgrounds can now be added to grid maps (vs just Hex before). You can configure the grid size here, and adjust it the same way you could hex ones in order to align Windrose's grid with any grid that may be preexisting on the image.
