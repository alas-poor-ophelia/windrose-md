## Version 1.5.2
This one took a bit longer, but here we are.

### Features
- Additional object rotation options: objects can now be rotated to 45 degree angles. Objects are still rotated the same way (`R` on keyboard, or button in the selection toolbar).
- Several improvements/additions to the random dungeon generation.
	- Dungeon Stocking
		- When generating a dungeon, you may now choose to "stock" it with objects like enemies, traps, and treasure.
		- You can adjust this with a series of sliders for overall percentage, and tune the percent chance of each type of object.
		- Optional "room styles": Barracks, Library, Shrine. Just a chance for some preset object combinations to show up as room types.
	- Diagonal corridors. Random dungeons can now have diagonal corridors (via the segmented cell feature). Chance is tuneable under settings
	- Water. Dungeons can now have "water", which is just blue painted tiles. Caverns have a chance of spawning underwater monsters and treasure if using Dungeon Stocking.
