## Version 1.5.3
### New Features
- Add an "auto fog of war" option to the Advanced Section for map generation, which will place fog of war over everything but the entrance room. Remove fog of war tiles from the visibility menu accessed of of the Windrose map menu (hover the compass).

### Improvements
- Added option to reroll only dungeon stocked objects to the reroll button dialog. This will preserve the map layout but reroll objects.

### Bug Fixes
- Fixed hopefully a majority of the "floating door" bugs. In some cases, the fix for this is to generate edges to create clearer cut boundaries. This results in some thinner interior walls. This is technically a bandaid for a larger corridor carving issue, but I think it's kind of interesting actually.
